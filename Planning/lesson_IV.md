#Lesson IV: Moving data to and from your new computer (45min)

##Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to securely move files to and from a running VM using scp and 
Cyberduck.

##Motivation 

In order to work with NeCTAR VM's, researchers need to know how to securely move files between a VM and their desktop.

##Story

Anna Prentice knows that there are files on the VM that should be backed up off of the machine. 
So she uses Cyberduck to bring them down to her local desktop, where they can be kept as an off-site backup.

##Tasks

The students will first move a file to the server from their local machine by means of scp.

Next they will install Cyberduck, and use it to move files between the two machines.

##Covers

SCP, Cyberduck

##Concepts

Using the shell to transfer files, and using Cyberduck to move files.
