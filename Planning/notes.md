# Notes

We are targeting the power user: but focusing as much as possible on the dashboard.
We are creating a course that those who take can then take ownership of and spread the word to others.

The intent is to create a really good 1 day course. In time we may add a second day for real power users (see stretch
goals).

Alpha course is set to be delivered in August.
Beta course is set to be delivered in September.

## Potential Sales pitches

"My other computer is a data center"
"A free computer!"
"Free USB sticks"

## Prerequisites

Can we turn Cygwin installation into a prerequisite for windows users?

## Questions

### Q: Why not just use Amazon?

**A:** Consider:

* Amazon is a lot, lot more complex. 
* Amazon costs: and those costs can climb quite rapidly if you don't take care!
* Your data on NeCTAR is in Australia, under the control of an Australian organization subject to Australian laws.
* NeCTAR and the Universities are connected to ARNET: so you have a really fast network to move your data around with.
  This becomes especially important when you have large datasets.

On the other hand, Amazon offers way more services than NeCTAR. And has far more extensive infrastructure. So you
have to balance your needs. You can, with the right tool choices, use both.
  
### Q: Why not just use FigShare?

**A:** Consider:
 
* Not all institutions have or use FigShare
* The NeCTAR cloud offers a uniform interface that many applications can work with.
* You are not locked into a proprietary platform - if NeCTAR goes away, you can migrate easily. 
* FigShare and NeCTAR are actually complementary: The NeCTAR cloud allows you to run applications - those applications 
  can make use of your data in FigShare. And you can keep intermediate data in  

### Q: What about RunMyCode.org?

**A:** RunMyCode.org is a great way of sharing your code and data: NeCTAR is a great way of developing/exercising that code
and data. They have slightly different goals.

### Q: What's the best example application to use for this course?

**A:** Decided on a dead simple web server type of box. Is a pre-configured drupal instance good enough, or is it too 
complicated?

### Q: What are some of the downsides of using the cloud?

**A:** 

> "The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of economics 
> of scale, and -- like any outsourced task -- you tend to get what you get. A restaurant with a limited menu is 
> cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it's a 
> feature, not a bug." - Bruce Schneier
