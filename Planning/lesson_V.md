#Lesson V: We can still run our graphical applications (30min)

##Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson participants will know that they can, if need be, use graphical applications on the remote
systems.

##Motivation 

This is of use if a researcher wants to

* run an graphical application on a data set on the remote server
* browse the internet from the remote server (can avoid local blocks)
* etc.
 
##Story

Anna Prentice wants to view a website that her local institution has blocked. She realizes that she can do this via
her remote server, so this is what she sets out to do.

Anna then wants to edit a file she finds on the remote server. Rather than doing this with a command line editor she
opts to use a one of the nice friendly GUI editors that she is familiar with.
