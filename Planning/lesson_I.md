# Lesson I: OpenStack, mapped by the dashboard (45 mins)

## Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson participants will be familiar with the basic parts of OpenStack and be able to 
locate them on the dashboard. They will also understand that the machines they launch are virtual.

## Motivation

A researcher needs to understand the Dashboard and the underlying parts of OpenStack, in order to use it.

## Story

To motivate the students:

Two researchers blow 20K of grant money on computers - that they didn't have to, had NeCTAR been around!

##Tasks

To find and map the parts of the dashboard to  their respective OpenStack components. Done as a guided tour of 
the dashboard, rather like a tour guide would do...
 
## Covers

All major OpenStack components, Horizon, the AAF & Allocations, and how to get support if help is needed. 

## Concepts

Modular nature of OpenStack, Glance, Nova, Allocations, Virtualization, Key Pairs, Security Groups, IP allocation.

## Notes 


## To discuss

The basics of virtualization, the parts of OpenStack at a very high level, and the allocations screen. 

How the image is passed from Glance to Nova.

Its worthwhile driving home that to use the cloud, you do need to get your head around some key concepts; and that they 
are not difficult

Where to go to get help if you need it.

Introduce the concepts of Key Pairs and Security Groups, and IP allocation.
