#Lesson I OpenStack, mapped by the dashboard (45min)


**Objective:** 

By the end of this lesson participants will be familiar with the basic parts of OpenStack and be able to 
locate them on the dashboard.

**Motivation:** 

The researcher needs to understand the Dashboard and the underlying parts of OpenStack, in order to use it.

**Story**

A researcher, Anna Prentice wants to learn R at home: and use it at work. Not having a laptop, and looking at the 
RStudio website, she sees that there is a server version. She decides that if she can run it on the NeCTAR cloud it
would support her needs. But to do this she first needs to be able to understand the parts of the NeCTAR cloud.

**Task:**

To find and map the parts of the dashboard to  their respective OpenStack components. Done as a guided tour of 
the dashboard, rather like a tour guide would do...
 
**Covers:**

All OpenStack Components, Horizon, esp. Keystone and the AAF & Allocations 

**Concepts:**

Modular nature of OpenStack, Allocations

**Notes:** 

**To discuss:** 

The basics of virtualization, the parts of OpenStack at a very high level, and the allocations screen. 
Its worthwhile driving home that to use the cloud, you do need to get your head around some key concepts; and that they 
are not difficult

One possible metaphor for virtualization is that you have a small closet: with clothes in it. AKA, a server. But you 
also have a very big closet: into which you can either put clothes, or, perhaps more efficiently, lots of copies of the 
smaller closet, thus giving you better space utilization.
