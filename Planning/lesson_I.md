# Lesson I: OpenStack, mapped by the dashboard (45 mins)

## Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson participants will be familiar with the basic parts of OpenStack and be able to 
locate them on the dashboard.

## Motivation

A researcher needs to understand the Dashboard and the underlying parts of OpenStack, in order to use it.

## Story

To motivate the students:

Two researchers blow 20K of grant money on computers - that they didn't have to, had NeCTAR been around!

##Tasks

To find and map the parts of the dashboard to  their respective OpenStack components. Done as a guided tour of 
the dashboard, rather like a tour guide would do...
 
## Covers

All OpenStack Components, Horizon, the AAF & Allocations, and how to get support if help is needed. 

##Concepts

Modular nature of OpenStack, Allocations

##Notes 


##To discuss

The basics of virtualization, the parts of OpenStack at a very high level, and the allocations screen. 

Its worthwhile driving home that to use the cloud, you do need to get your head around some key concepts; and that they 
are not difficult

Where to go to get help if you need it.
