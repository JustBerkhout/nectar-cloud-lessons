# Lesson VIII: The object store: in more detail (30 min)

##Learning objectives 

By the end of this lesson participants will understand and be able to use the object store, and know some of the 
advantages that it confers.

##Motivation 

Having seen the horrors of transient storage, the researchers now want a more secure location for their data. 
The object store it is!

##Story

Anna Prentice wants a more secure storage location for her data. Knowing that the Object store makes redunant copies
she decides to put her data there.

##Tasks

The students need to encrypt (?) and then upload their backup that they downloaded to their desktop to the Swift 
object repository. 

To do this this time they will user CyberDuck

## Covers

Using CyberDuck to connect to the object store.

## Concepts

Object Storage, redundancy etc..

## Notes 

This is a reprise of the exercise done in lesson one. But now with extra added detail around Swift.

## To discuss 

Swift, its three copies, out of 5, its eventually consistent nature, the differences between Swift and a hard drive. 
Also, the importance of an off site copy and the encryption of backups.
