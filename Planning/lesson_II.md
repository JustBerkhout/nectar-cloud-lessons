#Lesson II: Your free computer: up and running (45min)

##Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to locate and launch an image on the NeCTAR cloud - and 
understand that the resultant machine is virtual.

##Motivation 

These are the basic steps required to successfully run a VM on the NeCTAR cloud. 

##Story

A researcher, Anna Prentice wants to set up a simple website, to share some data with the world. 

Now knowing the parts of the NeCTAR cloud, Anna decides to see if she can find an image available on the 
NeCTAR cloud can do this for her - and launch and play with it.

##Tasks

Create a security group, find the correct image, spin it up, connect to it with a web browser and then take it down

##Covers

Glance, Nova, Security Groups

##Concepts

Virtualization, moving an image from Glance to Nova, Security Groups, IP number allocation

##Notes 



##To discuss 

Nova and its message passing architecture, Glance and Horizon, how the disk is passed from glance to Nova, 
networking, security groups and IP number allocation. Note the state changes as the instance is spun up and 
how they show the message passing architecture of OpenStack
