#User Personas

A persona is the representation of the goals and behaviour of a group of hypothetical users. By considering three to
four personas when doing design  you are more likely to have a successful outcome.

For more on personas, there is the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29) and of
course, the book [The Inmates are Running the Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140).

This document contains the personaâ€™s driving the development of the NeCTAR Introduction to the Cloud training course.
