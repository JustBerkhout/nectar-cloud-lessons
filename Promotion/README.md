## Intro to the cloud

**Overview** This [talk](Talk/Intro_to_the_cloud.md) is a high level introduction to the conceptual foundations, advantages, disadvantages, and the
parts of the NeCTAR research cloud. If you understand these then you'll be far less likely to be bitten in your
journey to the cloud: and given the scale and low price of the research cloud you will, most likely, be making
that journey.

**Target Time:** +- 45 minutes
