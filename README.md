# NeCTAR cloud lesson plan

This course will aim to teach the basics of the NeCTAR cloud.

The notes here are for a 1 hour 30 minute workshop.

## Part 1: The NeCTAR Dashboard (45 minutes)

This lesson is contained in the Lesson_I folder.
It covers the web interface to the NeCTAR cloud in high level.

The main lesson is [here](Lesson_I/Lesson_I.md)
The supporting questions are [here](Lesson_I/Lesson_I_Questions.pptx)
There is a PDF version of the supporting questions as well.

## Part 2: Firing up a VM (45 minutes)

This lesson is contained in the Lesson_II folder.
It covers launching a VM.

The main lesson is [here](Lesson_II/Lesson_II.md)
The supporting questions are [here](Lesson_II/Lesson_II_Questions.pptx)
There is a PDF version of the supporting questions as well.

There are also three checklists to be used during the lesson

* [ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf)
* [ChecklistCreatingASecurityGroup.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistCreatingASecurityGroup.pdf)
* [ChecklistStartingAnInstance.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistStartingAnInstance.pdf)

## Extension Challenge

There is also a set of extension challenges, should time permit: [ExtraChallenges.md](Extension/ExtraChallenges.md).
These cover connecting to the VM.

## Delivering the lesson

The lessons assume that participants have both red and green coloured sticky notes and cards lettered from "A" through
to "E" (in the style of Software Carpentry). These are used to answer questions and to show distress if the students
aren't keeping up.

It would be helpful if each participant also received a printed copy of each of the checklists, and a printed copy of
the extension challenge for them to take away to work on if they don't complete the tasks during the lesson.

## Thoughts after delivering the two lessons

The sticky notes as a token of progress didn't work that well. People would leave them up after prior exercises, and
not take them down when starting new ones. This is after three days of using them! Either I was out of sync with the
way in which these should be used, or human procrastination kicked in. I got tired of reminding people to take them
down at the start of each exercise. I wonder if a more aggressive red card for "help" and a general show of hands as
to if I can continue would be better?

The lecture notes as they stand at the moment don't have a conclusion in them. I just winged one at the end.
I also forgot to, but should have, reminded everyone to shutdown their virtual machines at the end of the class.

A large number of people managed to get to the "homework" that I didn't expect them reach. This should hence be
better documented. In the original scheme of things, this is intended to be its own 45 minute lesson.

The multi-choice questions worked really well. They let me pick up concepts that had not been conveyed properly, and
have another go at explaining them. The concepts that were missed in each case were only missed by a very small number
of people, so it's probably not worth trying to change the lessons in this regard - however, if a consistent pattern
builds up then they should be changed.

The password section and the external access sections should be put into their own lesson. They simply distract from
the goal of these two, which is to get a VM up and running, and then to access it.

Some diagrams showing the movement of the files as a VM is launched would be a good idea. I just used words, and
although I got the point across this would make it easier and faster.

A number of people came up after the lecture and stated that they thought that this was a missing piece in the puzzle
of how to start on the NeCTAR cloud. They asked if this could be televised or become a "MOOC".
