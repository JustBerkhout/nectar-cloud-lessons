# NeCTAR cloud lesson plan

This course aims to teach the basics of the NeCTAR cloud to researchers over a one to two day workshop.

> "We are ... looking to find (and train) what we are calling a "power (researcher) users".  
>
> From our work with the Research Bazaar here in Melbourne we've discovered that there is an increasing number of 
> researchers who are turning to the Cloud as there "Operating System" of choice, we call this "ResOS".
>
> Our investigation into these types of users produce the following kind of persona traits (which is whom we are aiming 
> this "ResOS Train the Trainer curriculum").  "Power (Researcher) Users" are the types of researchers who see 
> themselves as:
>
>* technically savvy (the person in the lab who everyone goes to for help);
>* they feel they are researcher first and foremost, e.g. they usually introduce themselves as "researchers" but are 
>  very happy for their research colleagues to identify them as "technical".
>* sometimes these users are hired for their technical skills and identified as the research groups developer, but they 
>  do have discipline expertise.
>* often they are a postgraduate or early career researcher; far too often they are male.
>* types of people who immediately un-installed the operating systems which the University provided them on their 
>  laptop and replaced it with an OS which allowed them to have access to the "Utilities", "Settings" and 
>  "Advanced Settings" of their Operating System. 
>* they've even played around with installing Linux Ubuntu and other "command line" tasks.
>* while they understand the basics of installing an OS, it is only a means to an end so they can access more of the 
>  research tools which get them and their colleagues results.
>* for them the cloud is just someone else's computer and they are only just willing to trust a computer the University 
>  runs so long as no restrictions are made on them about how they use it (they are glad to go back to doing it 
>  themselves if there are any barriers or bureaucracy put up by the University).
>
> The purpose of the above persona is to provide a training to all the nodes (via creative commons) so we can train up 
> these PowerUsers in how to use the Cloud Operating System (NeCTAR OpenStack) so that they can customise it with the 
> apps that will make it their own discipline specific "ResOS".
> ...
> Once we test the training we hope to take it out on the road to each of the nodes so we can train up at least 
> 6-12 people in each city."

## Motivator

It’s been hyped: but the Cloud does offer serious value in terms of cost and instant availability to researchers.
However, it’s a complex tool and if you don’t know and understand its constraints trying to make use of it can end
in painful tears. This course introduces you to the the tools and the underlying concepts of the NeCTAR cloud -
thus reducing your risk and saving you time and trouble in your journey to the cloud. And given the scale and low price 
of the research cloud you will, most likely, be making that journey.

The directories that make up this project are as follows:

* [Lessons](Lessons/) - The lessons themselves
* [Planning](Planning/lesson_plans.md) - The materials that were used to create the course

## Delivering the lessons

The lessons assume that participants have both red and green coloured sticky notes and cards lettered from "A" through
to "E" (in the style of Software Carpentry). These are used to answer questions and to show distress if the students
aren't keeping up or need help.

## The questions

The sticky notes as a token of progress didn't work that well. People would leave them up after prior exercises, and
not take them down when starting new ones. This is after three days of using them! Either I was out of sync with the
way in which these should be used, or human procrastination kicked in. I had to repeatedly reminding people to take them
down at the start of each exercise. 

To tackle this possibly try to be a bit more authoritarian about the sticky notes the next time the lessons are given?

The multi-choice questions worked really well. They let me pick up concepts that had not been conveyed properly, and
have another go at explaining them. The concepts that were missed in each case were only missed by a very small number
of people, so it's probably not worth trying to change the lessons in this regard - however, if a consistent pattern
builds up then they should be changed.

However, if these lessons are given by multiple people then tracking the answers to the multiple choice questions is 
going to be hard. Given that all of the students have lap tops, perhaps we could use a clicker like web program to
ask the questions and gather the data? Read more about the pro's and con's of Clickers

## Audience feedback,

A couple of people came up after the lecture and stated that they thought that this was a missing piece in the puzzle
of how to get started on the NeCTAR cloud. They asked if this could be televised or turned into a "MOOC"...
