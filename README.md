## Extension Challenge

There is also a set of extension challenges, should time permit: [ExtraChallenges.md](Extension/ExtraChallenges.md).
These cover connecting to the VM.

## Delivering the lesson

The lessons assume that participants have both red and green coloured sticky notes and cards lettered from "A" through
to "E" (in the style of Software Carpentry). These are used to answer questions and to show distress if the students
aren't keeping up.

It would be helpful if each participant also received a printed copy of each of the checklists, and a printed copy of
the extension challenge for them to take away to work on if they don't complete the tasks during the lesson.
