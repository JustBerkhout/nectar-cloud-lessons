# NeCTAR cloud lesson plan

This course aims to teach the basics of the NeCTAR cloud to researchers over a one day workshop.

> "We are ... looking to find (and train) what we are calling a "power (researcher) users".  
>
> From our work with the Research Bazaar here in Melbourne we've discovered that there is an increasing number of 
> researchers who are turning to the Cloud as there "Operating System" of choice, we call this "ResOS".
>
> Our investigation into these types of users produce the following kind of persona traits (which is whom we are aiming 
> this "ResOS Train the Trainer curriculum").  "Power (Researcher) Users" are the types of researchers who see 
> themselves as:
>
>* technically savvy (the person in the lab who everyone goes to for help);
>* they feel they are researcher first and foremost, e.g. they usually introduce themselves as "researchers" but are 
>  very happy for their research colleagues to identify them as "technical".
>* sometimes these users are hired for their technical skills and identified as the research groups developer, but they 
>  do have discipline expertise.
>* often they are a postgraduate or early career researcher; far too often they are male.
>* types of people who immediately un-installed the operating systems which the University provided them on their 
>  laptop and replaced it with an OS which allowed them to have access to the "Utilities", "Settings" and 
>  "Advanced Settings" of their Operating System. 
>* they've even played around with installing Linux Ubuntu and other "command line" tasks.
>* while they understand the basics of installing an OS, it is only a means to an end so they can access more of the 
>  research tools which get them and their colleagues results.
>* for them the cloud is just someone else's computer and they are only just willing to trust a computer the University 
>  runs so long as no restrictions are made on them about how they use it (they are glad to go back to doing it 
>  themselves if there are any barriers or bureaucracy put up by the University).
>
> The purpose of the above persona is to provide a training to all the nodes (via creative commons) so we can train up 
> these PowerUsers in how to use the Cloud Operating System (NeCTAR OpenStack) so that they can customise it with the 
> apps that will make it their own discipline specific "ResOS".
> ...
> Once we test the training we hope to take it out on the road to each of the nodes so we can train up at least 
> 6-12 people in each city."

## Motivator

It’s been hyped: but the Cloud does offer serious value in terms of cost and instant availability to researchers.
However, it’s a complex tool and if you don’t know and understand its constraints trying to make use of it can end
in painful tears. This course introduces you to the the tools and the underlying concepts of the NeCTAR cloud -
thus reducing your risk and saving you time and trouble in your journey to the cloud. And given the scale and low price 
of the research cloud you will, most likely, be making that journey.

## Folders

The directories that make up this project are as follows:

* [Promotion](Promotion/README.md) - Promotional material to use in advance of the course
* [Prerequisites](Prerequisites/) - What we would like students and trainers to do before they step through the door
* [Lessons](Lessons/) - The lessons themselves
* [Planning](Planning/lesson_plans.md) - The materials that were used to create the course
* [Resources](Resources/) - The resources that students will be using during the course
* [Diary](Dairy/) - Notes made from giving the course.

## Delivering the lessons

The lessons assume that participants have both red and green coloured sticky notes and cards lettered from "A" through
to "E" (in the style of Software Carpentry). These are used to answer questions and to show distress if the students
aren't keeping up or need help.

## Instructors notes

### In general

Each person being taught needs to be given 
    
* a red sticky note 
* a green sticky note.
* A set of answer cards, lettered 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' respectively.

### Preparation for lesson III

You will need a few copies of the [play](https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons/blob/master/Resources/Play.md) for lesson 3.
People will have to crowd round and share. The goal here is to get people moving and interacting, as they become 
familiar with some concepts.

You will need to write the following words onto cards in big print, one word per card:

* PWD
* LS
* MKDIR
* CD
* CHMOD
* OTHER
* USER
* GROUP

### Todo

#### Must do

1. [ ] Bring the Kanban stuff into this "todo" list.
1. [ ] Work through the lesson 2 defects in github
1. [ ] Add some more images to checklists
1. [ ] Investigate the use of MobaXTerm or Babun instead of CygWin...

#### Nice to have

1. [ ] Possibly add an FAQ of synonym's? Have things like drive, PC, server, IP, Web address, HTTP, link etc...
1. [ ] As a Chromebook user can I have an online SSH like resbaz.cloud.edu shell tool?

### For "Train the Trainer

1. [ ] Update this document to reflect the two in one
1. [ ] Complete the "Train-the-trainers" additions
1. [ ] As in Software Carpentry, should trainers who submit a GitHub correction get a certificate?
