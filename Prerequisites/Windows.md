The following instructions are not applicable until after lessons 2 and
3.

In the hostname box you will put your VM's ip address. You can specify 
a user name if you like, if you don't, you will be asked every time you
login.

Because we use a Public/Private Key for security access, you will need 
to click on the "Advanced SSH settings" tab, tick the "Use private key"
box and put the location of the key in the field next to it.
