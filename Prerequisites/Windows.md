#Putty on MS-Windows

## Installing Putty 

Go to the [Putty download page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

Then download and run the Windows MSI installer [putty-0.67-installer.msi](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.67-installer.msi)
This saves some configuration work if you elect to download the stand alone components.

## Installing Xming

Go to the [Xming download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/). Then download the Xming installer. 
Run the installer, accepting all of the defaults as you step through the wizard.
