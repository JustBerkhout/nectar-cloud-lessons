1. [ ] Go the [NeCTAR dashboard page](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/) and confirm that you can log in using your AAF credentials.
1. [ ] If you are running MS windows, install [Cygwin](Windows.md) <- click on the link for instructions.
1. [ ] If you are running a Mac, install [X11](OSX.md) <- click on the link for instructions.
1. [ ] Install the [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) client that is correct for your laptop.

If you have any problems, or need any help with any of these steps, simply create an
