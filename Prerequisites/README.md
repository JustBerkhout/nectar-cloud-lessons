# Prerequisites

These are the steps you need to have taken before arriving at the course. 

1. [ ] Make sure that you have an [AAF](http://aaf.edu.au/) login. Your institution should
       have more information on its web site. E.g. 
       [The University of Sydney's information page](http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/667/~/what-is-the-australian-access-federation-%28aaf%29%3F)
1. [ ] Go the [NeCTAR dashboard page](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/) and confirm that you can log in using your 
       AAF credentials. When you do this for the first time, you will activate a new 
       [trial project](https://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/allocations). If you have previous logged onto the 
       dashboard confirm that your trail project is still active, and if not request an extension for this course.
1. [ ] If you are running MS windows, install [Cygwin](Windows.md) (the link gives instructions).
1. [ ] If you are running a Mac, install [X11](OSX.md) (the link gives instructions).
1. [ ] Install the [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) client that is correct for your laptop.

If you have any problems, or need any help with any of these steps, simply create an 
[issue](https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons/issues).
