#Beta delivery at Unimelb, 2015

## On lesson I:

    Tim: I haven't done anything yet, so why am I learning about allocations?

This is tough: logically it should go to the end of the lessons, but then people might leave early, and miss the
bits about their allocation expiring after 3 months, and how to extend them. Which is important.

    Fiona: Can the help stuff come later? It has been 15 mins and I haven't done anything yet
    
Is this valid? If so, we should rejig somehow...

    Bernard: How do I calculate how many core hours? What about location?

Is this important - or will it confuse some people?

    Fiona: Can there be some more rationale - what is this going to let me do? 
    Refer back to the applications/ benefits more often

This should be salted through the lesson a bit more?

    Fiona: Can all this content on images (maintaining them etc) come later once we've created something? 
    Like the questions & structure but it's a bit abstract

Part of the rejig?

    Bernard: No rules appeared when I created a new security group
    
This seems to be rather random, and depends on the user. We need to dig further and find out what NeCTAR are doing here.

    Fiona: Should be getting the group to do the activities creating key pairs & security groups along with you

As part of the rejig, we should perhaps bin the demonstration, and head straight into the checklists? I'm a bit
nervous about this, as I think less technically able people might like to see it done first. Perhaps it's a line
call that should be done based on the prowess of the students? I'm thinking that we should try both approaches on 
this demographic and see which is better.

    Tim: I wasn't able to use my pt account to create a new instance because it had already exceeded its quota.

We are just going to have to get people like this to pair up with others: the only other way to handle this is
to create a special tenancy for the lesson, and then to add people like this to it...

### Overall

Should we add some scenarios for what you'll need to know when colleagues have found out about your new 
cloud manager skills, and want you to do different things with their images: e.g.: one colleague wants things 
backed up and archived for long term, one one a clean install, one wants... etc?
