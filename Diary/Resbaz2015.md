# Thoughts after delivering the first two lessons as a 1.45 hour workshop.

## The questions

The sticky notes as a token of progress didn't work that well. People would leave them up after prior exercises, and
not take them down when starting new ones. This is after three days of using them! Either I was out of sync with the
way in which these should be used, or human procrastination kicked in. I had to repeatedly reminding people to take them
down at the start of each exercise. 

To tackle this possibly try to be a bit more authoritarian about the sticky notes the next time the lessons are given?

The multi-choice questions worked really well. They let me pick up concepts that had not been conveyed properly, and
have another go at explaining them. The concepts that were missed in each case were only missed by a very small number
of people, so it's probably not worth trying to change the lessons in this regard - however, if a consistent pattern
builds up then they should be changed.

However, if these lessons are given by multiple people then tracking the answers to the multiple choice questions is 
going to be hard. Given that all of the students have lap tops, perhaps we could use a clicker like web program to
ask the questions and gather the data? Read more about the pro's and con's of Clickers

## Audience feedback,

A couple of people came up after the lecture and stated that they thought that this was a missing piece in the puzzle
of how to get started on the NeCTAR cloud. They asked if this could be televised or turned into a "MOOC"...
