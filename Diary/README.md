# Delivery Diary

These are notes made after delivering the course. Hopefully we can turn them into actionable changes: in that way we 
can improve the course over time.

#Beta delivery at Unimelb, 2015

## On lesson I:

    Tim: I haven't done anything yet, so why am I learning about allocations?

This is tough: logically it should go to the end of the lessons, but then people might leave early, and miss the
bits about their allocation expiring after 3 months, and how to extend them. Which is important.

    Fiona: Can the help stuff come later? It has been 15 mins and I haven't done anything yet
    
Is this valid? If so, we should rejig somehow...

    Bernard: How do I calculate how many core hours? What about location?

Is this important - or will it confuse some people?

    Fiona: Can there be some more rationale - what is this going to let me do? 
    Refer back to the applications/ benefits more often

This should be salted through the lesson a bit more?

    Fiona: Can all this content on images (maintaining them etc) come later once we've created something? 
    Like the questions & structure but it's a bit abstract

Part of the rejig?

    Bernard: No rules appeared when I created a new security group
    
This seems to be rather random, and depends on the user. We need to dig further and find out what NeCTAR are doing here.

    Fiona: Should be getting the group to do the activities creating key pairs & security groups along with you

As part of the rejig, we should perhaps bin the demonstration, and head straight into the checklists? I'm a bit
nervous about this, as I think less technically able people might like to see it done first. Perhaps it's a line
call that should be done based on the prowess of the students? I'm thinking that we should try both approaches on 
this demographic and see which is better.

    Tim: I wasn't able to use my pt account to create a new instance because it had already exceeded its quota.

We are just going to have to get people like this to pair up with others: the only other way to handle this is
to create a special tenancy for the lesson, and then to add people like this to it...

### Overall

Should we add some scenarios for what you'll need to know when colleagues have found out about your new 
cloud manager skills, and want you to do different things with their images: e.g.: one colleague wants things 
backed up and archived for long term, one one a clean install, one wants... etc?

# eResearch 2015 NeCTAR workshop

The second lesson was split up between several other speakers, with each checklist being given as a stand alone
section.

It worked fairly well IMHO. 

We asked the attendees to log any issues with the github issue tracker - and got about 9 suggested improvements! So
this also seems to be a good idea.

One of them, not resolved, but perhaps worth monitoring, was the following:

    In the ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf form, I use FoxitPDF,(opens the PDF in browser) and
    could not copy/paste anything into the "blocks". Small issue but could be annoying to users.

If it does turn out that there are lots of other FoxitPDF users then somehow we will have to fix it 
(switch to html forms?).

One thing: everyone was remarkably bad about cleaning up their security groups and instances after themselves 
in a shared training tenancy. If in such a tenancy in future it might be worthwhile adding a script that will
blow everything away for the instructors benefit...

# Thoughts after delivering the first two lessons as a 1.45 hour workshop.

## The questions

The sticky notes as a token of progress didn't work that well. People would leave them up after prior exercises, and
not take them down when starting new ones. This is after three days of using them! Either I was out of sync with the
way in which these should be used, or human procrastination kicked in. I had to repeatedly reminding people to take them
down at the start of each exercise. 

To tackle this possibly try to be a bit more authoritarian about the sticky notes the next time the lessons are given?

The multi-choice questions worked really well. They let me pick up concepts that had not been conveyed properly, and
have another go at explaining them. The concepts that were missed in each case were only missed by a very small number
of people, so it's probably not worth trying to change the lessons in this regard - however, if a consistent pattern
builds up then they should be changed.

However, if these lessons are given by multiple people then tracking the answers to the multiple choice questions is 
going to be hard. Given that all of the students have lap tops, perhaps we could use a clicker like web program to
ask the questions and gather the data? Read more about the pro's and con's of Clickers

## Audience feedback,

A couple of people came up after the lecture and stated that they thought that this was a missing piece in the puzzle
of how to get started on the NeCTAR cloud. They asked if this could be televised or turned into a "MOOC"...
