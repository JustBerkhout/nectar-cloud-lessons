# eResearch 2015 NeCTAR workshop

The second lesson was split up between several other speakers, with each checklist being given as a stand alone
section.

It worked fairly well IMHO. 

We asked the attendees to log any issues with the github issue tracker - and got about 9 suggested improvements! So
this also seems to be a good idea.

One of them, not resolved, but perhaps worth monitoring, was the following:

    In the ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf form, I use FoxitPDF,(opens the PDF in browser) and
    could not copy/paste anything into the "blocks". Small issue but could be annoying to users.

If it does turn out that there are lots of other FoxitPDF users then somehow we will have to fix it 
(switch to html forms?).

One thing: everyone was remarkably bad about cleaning up their security groups and instances after themselves 
in a shared training tenancy. If in such a tenancy in future it might be worthwhile adding a script that will
blow everything away for the instructors benefit...
