# One off sync from command line?
1. this uses the owncloudcmd binary from the owncloud client install
1. get your owncloud password from cloudstor (not your AAF one)
1. put it into ~/.owncloud.password
`flock -n /tmp/tmp.lockfile owncloudcmd --user you@your.work.com --password `cat ~/.owncloud.password` ~/ownCloud/ https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/`
1. you could even add this to cron.

what does `flock` do?  it won't let two of these commands run at the same time.
