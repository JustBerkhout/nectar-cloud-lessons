Files and Directories

When you open your Explorer (Windows) or Finder (OsX) you can see that the contents on your
hard drive are organized as files stored inside of folders.

**Demonstrate using your Finder**

And that the folders can be contained within other folders.

When you open a terminal window you are opening a text based interface into that system.

There is a terminology change though:

Folders are called 'directories'. And files are called, well, 'files'

So how to navigate it?

As the terminal can't give you the same view, it simply has the concept of being positioned in one of those folders.
And that directory that it is positioned in is termed the 'working directory'

And you have this concept in your Explorer/Finder as well. Each window you open is positioned on a given
directory. And you can move in or out along the directory tree.

You can think of this directory that the Explorer/Finder window is positioned on as being the working directory for
that Explorer/Finder window.

**Demonstrate using your Finder**

Similarly each terminal window you open is positioned on a given directory.

Because the terminal is text based, you need to type in instructions as to what is to happen.

These instructions are called 'commands'.

You type in the command, then when you hit the enter key, the command is executed by the computer.

### In your ssh session

Try the following command:

```bash
pwd
```

`pwd` is shorthand for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory

* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = Help!
* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = I'm done

When a user logs into a Unix like system they ordinarily start with the working directory positioned
in a directory called their home directory:

### The home directory

```bash
/home/<<username>>
```
-- *Slide End* --

This is the directory where that users personal files, directories and programs are located.

### The home directory

When you typed in `pwd` is this what you saw?

```bash
/home/ubuntu
```

* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = No!
* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Yes

-- *Slide End* --

Remember, you ssh'd into the instance as the ubuntu user, and hence this is why your terminal session is
positioned here.

### Comments

In the terminal everything after a hash mark is ignored. We can use this to comment our examples:

```bash
cmd     # this is a comment that is ignored
```
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
### Options

Commands often have options

 ```bash
 <command> -<option[s]>
 ```
-- *Slide End* --

**Demonstrate**

 eg:

 ```bash
 ls -alrt   # list directory contents with options all, long and reverse time
 ```

BTW, `ls` is an abbreviation for "list"


The "man" command provides a description of the meaning and options for a command

**Demonstrate**

 ```bash
 man ls
 ```

'q' quits the man command, <space> pages.

Ok: time to put our feet up: we are going take a break and read a very bad story.

### Exercise

Agent 00? - we are going to relive your story!

There's a command line cheat sheet at: [http://tinyurl.com/command-line-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons/blob/master/Resources/CommandLineCheatSheet.md)

Use it to step the through the following tasks: [http://tinyurl.com/play-task](https://github.com/resbaz/nectar-cloud-lessons/blob/master/Resources/Task.md)

* <span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = My undercover career needs some help!
* <span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = I'm done!

But if you have problems remember to ask your neighbours first!

Interesting point about this exercise:

##  Why do files have extensions?

1. To help humans and computers know what's in the file
1. Because they aren't directories
1. Files don't have extensions. How dare you!
1. ANSI standard C12.22 mandates it.
1. All of the above...

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer A:** They are just there to help humans and computers know what's inside the file. Note that these days
graphical interfaces hide extensions on certain categories of files.

### What's command are you going to enter to save the world?

1. `CAFEBABE`
1. `BADBEAD`
1. `DEADCAFE`
1. `CAFEBEEF`
1. `DEADBEEF`

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer E:** Any "A's" will be a major worry!

### What's a disadvantage of terminal commands?

* If you know what you’re doing it’s faster to type than to point with a mouse
* They keep a history of your commands
* You can easily replay commands
* They are simple to automate
* They are verbose!

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer E:** They certainly aren't verbose!
