# Motivation to use the NeCTAR cloud?

*As an aside, after each volunteer description, have a vote with Green == good & Red == bad. Ask people as to why
they voted the way they did...*

*In intra group tasks, get them to rotate someone who is pretending to be the persona*

## Task

Let me give you the story I use in the very first lesson to try and provide some motivation to those doing the course.

(Recap the story of the two researchers).

By the end of the day I'm hoping that each of the groups will be able to come up with a similar motivational story for
their persona.

So make a headline on a piece of paper that says "Motivation" and come back to with ideas as the day progresses.
Then we'll trade these stories at the end of the day. If we find that there's a better story in there we can replace
my story!

group to show them.
