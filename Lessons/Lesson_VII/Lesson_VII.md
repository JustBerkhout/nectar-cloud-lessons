# Lesson VII: Transient storage (donâ€™t rely on it!) and sharing

http://tinyurl.com/rc-issue-15

-- *Slide End* --

In the last lesson, we launched our image based on our snapshot with the largest size possible.

Did any of you notice the ephemeral disk in the flavor details?

**Demonstrate**

That's what we are going to be looking at in this lesson. 

-- *Slide* --

Anna needs some extra disk space over and above the 10G image size. While she's ssh'd into her larger instance she
types 

```bash
df -h
```

(**d**isplay **f**ile usage)

And sees that she has 30 Gig of free space on `/mnt`

She decided to put her new files there. Has Anna made a mistake?

-- *Slide End* --

---

Hold up a Red sticky note if you think she has.
Otherwise a green one if you think all is well.

**A**

We are going to do an experiment to see who's correct.

Ssh into your running instance.

Do as Anna did and issue a `df -h`. You should see the same result as her.

---

Hold up a Red sticky note if you don't.
Otherwise a green one if you do.

-- *Slide* --

## Exercise 1, part 1

```bash
df -h
# check file permissions and make usable
ls -al /mnt/
sudo chmod a+rw /mnt/  
# Create two files
echo "This is file one" > /mnt/temp.txt
echo "This is file two" > home.txt
# Confirm their contents:
more /mnt/temp.txt
more home.txt
```

When done, make a snapshot of this machine.

Anyone want to hazard a guess as to what chmod does, and why is it needed?

Remember to make the snapshot of your running instance following our new best practices!

When it is complete then delete the original instance.

---

-- *Slide* --

## Exercise 1, part 2

Launch a new instance of the same flavor as the last from your new snapshot.

`ssh` into the new instance and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo chmod a+rw /mnt/ 
more home.txt
more /mnt/temp.txt
```

What's missing?

-- *Slide End* --

---

All being well, you should get a "No such file" error when you try to look at file1.txt.

Hold up a Red sticky note if you need help,
Otherwise a green one when you are done.

---

So where's the missing `temp.txt`?

When you launch an instance, the instance is given a second hard drive with a fair amount of of space on it.
That is the extra space that Anna found and used.

**NB** When you make a snapshot, the snapshot is only of the primary drive. Anything on the secondary 
ephemeral drive is not saved. 

You can get and run some fairly grunty machines on the Research Cloud cloud. But snapshots will only save your small 
primary drive. If you use the extra drive space you will not be able to back it up by means of snapshots!

**Q** So to repeat: has Anna made a mistake?

Hold up a Red sticky note if you think she has.
Otherwise a green one if you think all is well.

**A**

I'm hoping to see a sea of Red...

## Sharing

## Exercise 2

On the images tab of the dashboard, click the drop down button next to the "Launch" button. Select the 'Edit' option.

In the resultant dialogue give the image a description and check the public flag. Then save it.

-- *Slide End* --

---

Once it's saved go to the list of public images and see if you can find it in there. Yes, that's the whole world who
can now start an instance based on your image!

Hold up a Red sticky note if you need help,
and a Green one once you are done.

## Exercise 3

Beware the size ratchet!

> Anna made a snapshot of a 10Gig machine: and is now trying to launch it as a 5Gig flavor. 

What happens?

-- *Slide End* --

---

Hold up a Red sticky note if you think it's going to end in tears.
And a Green one if you think that it will launch.

---

**A**

Yep: the tears have it:

> Anna gets the error: "Error: Flavor's disk is too small for requested image..."

You can't cram a bigger snapshot down into a smaller instance.

We have seen that snapshots are convenient. But that they do impact the performance of the VM for a short while. 
And that without extra steps, snapshots of running instances can be inexact. 

However, if we power the machine off first, then we can get a good snapshot. But run the big risk that we forget to 
start the machine again.

We have also seen that snapshots allow you to move between different sized machines easily.

And we have learnt that snapshots only save the primary drive of an instance. If you use the secondary drive, for 
example to put large data sets on, you will not backup that data with a snapshot.

## Exercise 4

Make your shared snapshot private again!

-- *Slide End* --

Hold up a Red sticky note if you run into problems.

And a Green one once you are done.
