# Lessons

These are the lessons that form the course.

## Lesson I: The NeCTAR dashboard (45 minutes)

This lesson covers the web interface to the NeCTAR cloud in high level.

The main lesson is [here](Lesson_I/Lesson_I.md)
The supporting questions are [here](Lesson_I/Lesson_I_Questions.pptx)
There is a PDF version of the supporting questions as well.

## Lesson II: Firing up a VM (45 minutes)

This lesson covers the launching of a VM.

The main lesson is [here](Lesson_II/Lesson_II.md)
The supporting questions are [here](Lesson_II/Lesson_II_Questions.pptx)
There is a PDF version of the supporting questions as well.

There are also three checklists to be used during the lesson

* [ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistCreatingAKeypair.pdf)
* [ChecklistCreatingASecurityGroup.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistCreatingASecurityGroup.pdf)
* [ChecklistStartingAnInstance.pdf](Lesson_II/ChecklistStartingAnInstance.pdf)

It would be helpful if each participant also received a printed copy of each of the checklists, and a printed copy of
the extension challenge for them to take away to work on if they don't complete the tasks during the lesson.

The original ODF files of the checklists are included so that they can be edited with [LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org/) 
if they need to be changed.

This lesson covers using `ssh` to access the instance and `scp` to move files to and from the VM.
