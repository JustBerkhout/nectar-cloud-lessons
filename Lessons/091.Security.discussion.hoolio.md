## A Shared Responsibility Model

NeCTAR look after the cloud

**You** look after the stuff you put in it

-- *Slide End* --

When it comes to security, NeCTAR follow the shared responsibility model.

This means that you have a fair amount of responsibility.
 
But that's true of all the computers and software that you use.

## A good scout always:
* Knows what can happen
* Is prepared for it
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
## But i'm not a scout.. 
NeCTAR images do alot for you already:
* Blocks SSH access after N failed attempts
* Password auth is disabled
* Provides up to date images
* Default security group is empty

..but there is a lot left up to you

## It is true:
the minute you put a server onto the internet, automated scanners start probing it 
for weaknesses.

## Exercise

1. Run firefox on your instance
1. Go to: https://www.grc.com/shieldsup
1. Click on the 'Proceed' button
1. then select 'All Service Ports'

what do we see?

<br>
<span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = Help me!<br>
<span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Ask me for help!<br>

## The red dots are open ports

A port is like a door to your instance.  That's the conduit through which the baddies will get in.

Ideally you should have:
* As few open ports as possible
* Each locked up nice and tight

-- *Slide* --

### Q: If all you need is SSH, do you need 10 ports open?

## A: No
 
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
## Security groups

They control which ports are open to your instance.

(port are like the doors and windows to your home)
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
##Exercise: Blocking the front door

* Remove ssh from the security group on your VM
* Try to ssh in â€“ and fail!
* Create a special ssh only security group
* Add it to your running VM
* Try to ssh in: success?

-- *Slide* --
## A recommendation
 
Have a dedicated security group for ssh

Every new instance will use the default security group.  Changing it thusly effects every instance.

## Exercise

Apply system updates:

``` bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

<br>
<span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = Help me!<br>
<span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Ask me for help!
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
## Q: Why would you not enable unattended-upgrades?

### A: Because upgraded packages can break your workflow
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
## A recommendation
### Consider enabling automatic updates:

``` bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```
(TPAC images have this done already)

<br>
<span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = Help me!<br>
<span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Ask me for help!<br>
-- *Slide End* --

-- *Slide* --
## A recommendation
### Avoid running mail server

* Use ssmtp (server email via imap)
* Use a paid service such as MailChimp
* Talk to TPAC via helpdesk@tpac.org.au
