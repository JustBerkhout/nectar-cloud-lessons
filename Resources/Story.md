# Double Oh Who...

## Chapter 1

You wake to find yourself in a darkened room.

Your head hurts.

Slowly it all comes back.

You and agent Bond broke into the evil empire's warehouse.

Naturally the evil empire's henchmen didn't take to this kindly.

During the resultant hugely destructive altercation, the floor unexpectedly opened up beneath your feet,
dropping you into this darkened room. That's when you must have bumped your head and knocked yourself out.

In the distance you can still hear agent Bond battling with the evil henchmen. How does he manage to survive you
find yourself wondering...

## Chapter 2

In front of you, on a table sits a running computer. It has no keyboard, mouse or terminal. But that doesn't
deter you. You whip your laptop out of your backpack, and connect it to a handy network cable you spot.

The computer has a card taped to it. Peering closer, you see that it has an IP number and the name
"ubuntu" written on it.

Knowing that the agency has managed to infiltrate the evil empires computers, putting your public key onto all of
them, you launch your terminal application and ssh into the computer.

## Chapter 3

Once logged in, you confirm that you are indeed the ubuntu user.

And that you are in the ubuntu users home directory.

You get a list of the home directories contents.

You see that there is a directory labeled "TopSecret"

You change your current working directory to that directory.

You list the files in the directory: and sure enough, there is one, labelled "plan.txt"

You view its contents.

It contains instructions on the evil empire's master plan!

You foil the plan by deleting the file.

Then, with a delicious cackle, you make a directory with same name the file used to have! That should confuse
someone!

There was also a file named "important.txt"

To sow confusion you copy it into the directory you have just created.

Then delete the original.

## Chapter 4

Happy that you have saved the world by destroying the master plan, you exit the session,
pack up your laptop and leave the room, heading back to the outside world.

Once out of the building, you realise that you forgot about agent Bond!

You turn to go back, but in front of your astonished eyes, the evil empire's warehouse collapses...

Have any inside survived? Stay tuned for the next exciting installment!
