# A play in one act

## SCENE 1. Introductions all round

**Narrator**  

> Our fine play takes place inside a dodgy sharehouse in brunswick, cunningly named with great foresight 
by the victorian builders: “computer”

> And now, our cast will introduce themselves:

**PWD**

> I'm PWD - my great power is to simply tell you where you are. You can think of me as the godfather to Siri.

**LS**

> My name is List, but call me by my nickname, LS. As Batman is to Robin, so am I to PWD. I simply lists 
everything I see.

**MKDIR**

> I am MKDIR - a tradesman who can add rooms to your house at the drop of a hat!.

**CD** 

> Know me as CD: the Segway in the house. Hitch a ride with me when you want to go to a different room! 
I don's say much, but I do a lot of heavy lifting!

**CHMOD** 

> CHMOD am I. See me as the houses personal guardian. I control access to the documents in the house.

**OTHER** 

> I'm other: a drunken stranger who wandered in off of the street when I was walking past and saw this 
great party on the go.

**USER** 

> Hi everyone: I'm user, the housemate who hosted this party!

**GROUP** 

> And we are group, the other housemates who suffered the party…

## SCENE 2. The morning after 

**Narrator**

> And now, with formalities set to once side, we'll get our short play about nothing of any import
in the sharehouse named 'computer' started.

**OTHER**

> I'm so hung over.

> What a night. Just waking down the road when I saw this huge party. So I decided to join in. 
I can’t remember much more. PWD, where am I?

**PWD**

> You are in the lounge of the home known as computer.

**OTHER** 

> Those tequila slammers were so strong, I'm struggling to focus. LS, what's in here with me?

**LS** 

> Some beer crate chairs, cushions, and lots of empty bottles.

**USER** 

> Gosh, OTHER you're very strange. 

*Then as an aside*

> MKDIR create for me a writing room, and there I'll write down my true thoughts about
OTHER.

**MKDIR** 

> Doesn't talk, but makes building motions to one side of the room

**USER** 

> CD, take me to my new writing room.

**CD**

> Doesn't talk, but escorts USER to where the room was created by mkdir

**USER** 

> PWD, where am I now?

**PWD**

> Forgetful, aren't you? You are in the writing room, just off of the lounge in the home known as computer.

**USER**

> I'm going to ECHO my thoughts about OTHER into this new Diary.

**OTHER**

> Hm: I want to know what USER wrote about me! I think I'll take a peek.

**GROUP** 

> We do to! We want to peek as well!

**USER**

> Oops, CHMOD, protect my diary so that only I can read and write it!

**CHMOD** 

> Your wish is my command! Abracadabra - Not GROUP, NOT OTHER, but only USER can read!
USER, your diary is protected.

**USER**
 
> LS: what's in this room?

**LS** 

> Only your diary USER. Protected so that only you can read and write it!

**GROUP and OTHER** 

> Awww!

*Exeunt*
