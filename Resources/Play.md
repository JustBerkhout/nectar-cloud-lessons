# A play in one act

*Narrator:*  

The play takes place inside a dodgy sharehouse in brunswick, cunningly named with great foresight by the 
victorian builders: “computer”

And now, our cast will introduce themselves:

*PWD*

I'm PWD - my great power is to simply tell you where you are. You can think of me as the godfather to Siri.

*LS*

My name is List, but call by my nickname, LS. As Batman is to Robin, so am I to PWD. I simply lists everything I see.

*OTHER*

*OTHER*

Oh, no one is here! Maybe I can find something lying around to fund my next drink! CD, take me to the house library! 

*CD doesn't talk, but escorts OTHER somewhere else in the room*

*OTHER*

PWD, I'm still struggling to see. Where am I now?

*PWD*

You are in the house library.

*OTHER*

And LS, what's around me?

*LS*

Why, its
