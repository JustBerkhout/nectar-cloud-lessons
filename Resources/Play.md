# A play in one act

*Narrator:*  

The play takes place inside a dodgy sharehouse in brunswick, cunningly named with great foresight by the 
victorian builders: “computer”

And now, our cast will introduce themselves:

*PWD*

I'm PWD - my great power is to simply tell you where you are. You can think of me as the godfather to Siri.

*LS*

My name is List, but call by my nickname, LS. As Batman is to Robin, so am I to PWD. I simply lists everything I see.

*MAN*

I am MAN - the annoying friend who knows everything, and insists on going on and on about it if accidentally asked…

*MKDIR*

I am MKDIR - a tradesman who can add rooms to your house at the drop of a hat!.

*CD*

Know me as CD: the Segway in the house. Hitch a ride with me when you want to go to a different room! I don's say 
much, but I do a lot of heavy lifting!

*CHMOD*

CHMOD am I. See me as the houses personal guardian. I stop others from reading or scribbling in the housemates stuff.

*OTHER*

I'm other: a drunken stranger who wandered in off of the street when I was walking past and saw this great party on the
go.

*USER*

Hi everyone: I'm user, the housemate who hosted this party!

*GROUP*

And we are group, the other housemates who suffered the party…

*Narrator:*  

And without further ado, we'll get our short play about nothing started.

*OTHER*

I'm so hung over.

What a night. Just waking down the road when I saw this huge party. So I decided to join in. 
I can’t remember much more. PWD, where am I?

*PWD*

You are in the lounge of the home known as computer.

*OTHER*

LS, I'm struggling to focus. What's around me?

*LS* 

Some beer crate chairs, cushions, and lots of empty bottles.

*USER*

Gosh, OTHER you're very strange. 

**Then as an aside**

MKDIR create for me a writing room, and there I'll write down my true thoughts about
other.

*MKDIR*
 
Doesn't talk, but makes building motions to one side of the room

*USER*

CD, take me to my new writing room.

*CD*
 
Doesn't talk, but escorts USER to where the room was created by mkdir.

*USER*

PWD, where am I now?

*PWD*

You are in the writing room, just off of the lounge in the home known as computer.

*USER*

I'm going to echo my thoughts about other into this new Diary.

*OTHER*

Hm: I want to know what USER wrote about me! I think I'll take a peek.

*GROUP*

We do to! We want to peek as well!

*USER*

Oops! CHMOD, protect my diary so that only I can read and write it!

*CHMOD*

Your wish is my command! Abracadabra - your diary is protected.

*USER*

LS: what's in this room?

*LS*

Only your diary USER. Protected so that only you can read and write it!

*GROUP and OTHER*

Awww!
